## Dataset Overview
Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive medical dataset with the following characteristics:

* Dataset Size: 2,149 patient records
* Feature Count: 35 distinct variables
* Target Variable: Binary diagnosis (0: No Alzheimer's, 1: Alzheimer's)
* Class Distribution:
  * Negative Class (No Alzheimer's): 64.63%
  * Positive Class (Alzheimer's): 35.37%

## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes several critical steps to prepare the data for machine learning:

### Feature Selection
We removed non-predictive columns that could introduce noise or bias:
* Patient identifiers (PatientID)
* Confidential information (DoctorInCharge)

### Data Normalization
Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features, ensuring:
* Consistent scale across all features
* Improved performance for scale-sensitive algorithms
* Better convergence for gradient-based optimizers

### Dataset Partitioning
The data was split to ensure robust model evaluation:
* Training Set: 1,719 samples (80%)
* Testing Set: 430 samples (20%)

## Exploratory Analysis
Our analysis revealed several key feature categories:

### Medical Indicators
* Cognitive Assessment (MMSE scores)
* Lipid Profile:
  * Total Cholesterol
  * LDL Cholesterol
  * HDL Cholesterol
  * Triglycerides

### Lifestyle Factors
* Smoking Status
* Alcohol Consumption Patterns
* Physical Activity Levels
* Diet Quality Metrics
* Sleep Quality Assessment

### Behavioral Indicators
* Memory Complaint Frequency
* Confusion Episodes
* Disorientation Incidents
* Task Completion Difficulties

## Class Imbalance
To address the moderate class imbalance (64.63% vs 35.37%), we implemented several mitigation strategies:

### Balancing Techniques
* Model-level adjustments using class weights
* SMOTE for minority class oversampling
* Strategic majority class undersampling

## Machine Learning Models
Our analysis incorporates four primary classification models:

### 1. Logistic Regression
**Configuration:**
* Balanced class weights
* Standardized features
* Cross-validation framework

### 2. Random Forest Classifier
**Implementation Details:**
* Initial baseline with default parameters
* Feature importance analysis
* Hyperparameter optimization pending

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Setup:**
* Standardized feature scaling
* Kernel exploration (linear and RBF)
* Grid search optimization planned

### 4. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
**Implementation:**
* Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV
* Early stopping mechanisms
* Feature importance analysis

## Evaluation Framework
Our comprehensive evaluation strategy includes:

### Metrics
* Accuracy: Overall prediction correctness
* Precision: Positive predictive value
* Recall: Sensitivity measure
* F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
* ROC-AUC: Classification performance curve

### Visualization Tools
* Confusion Matrices
* ROC Curves
* Feature Importance Plots

## Project Roadmap
Upcoming project phases include:

1. Model Implementation
   * Complete Logistic Regression baseline
   * Train and evaluate remaining models
   * Document initial results

2. Optimization Phase
   * Cross-validation implementation
   * Hyperparameter tuning
   * Model ensemble exploration

3. Analysis and Documentation
   * Comparative model analysis

   * Final report preparation

## Conclusions
This project establishes a robust framework for Alzheimer's Disease classification using machine learning. The comprehensive approach, incorporating medical and lifestyle data, shows promise for:

* Early disease detection
* Risk factor identification
* Treatment planning support

The next phase will focus on model implementation and optimization, with results and detailed analysis to follow.
